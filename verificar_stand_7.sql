-- 1. Primeiro, vamos ver todos os stands do evento para encontrar o UUID do stand 7
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  status,
  event_id,
  created_at
FROM event_stands 
WHERE name LIKE '%stand 7%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- 2. Depois, vamos ver os pagamentos desse stand espec√≠fico
-- (Substitua o UUID abaixo pelo resultado da query acima)
SELECT
